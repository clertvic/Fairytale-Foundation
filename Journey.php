			    <p>Erika is an actress who recently moved back to Pittsburgh after receiving her BFA from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010. While she was living in her previous home of Philadelphia, she volunteered (through a Princess company) to visit children's hospitals as various princesses. Each visit she would meet a new incredibly special and brave child. Together they would sing, dance, read, laugh and make believe. Each visit meant a great deal to the children, and even more to Erika. She wanted to make this same magic possible in Pittsburgh. Through Indiegogo and the kind generosity of people around the nation, Erika raised $10,000 to help in this effort. Erika has since contracted various costume builders to help her build fairytale princess costumes to be used in Pittsburgh! Books and toys have also been bought to help make each visit special. While completely a volunteer venture, this work means so much to Erika and she is absolutely thrilled to be able to bring some make-believe to the children of Pittsburgh's hospitals.

<p>A note from Erika: A huge thank you to every person who has supported this project thus far. Your support has meant so much to me, and I am so excited to start visiting these kids! I'll do my best to keep everyone updated as things progress, but know that you're all with me as I sing and dance through the hospital hallways. I am bursting with gratitude, and thank you from the bottom of my heart.
