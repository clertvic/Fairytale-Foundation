			    <p>A mom found me in the hallway and gently said, “If it was any other princess I wouldn’t bother, but my son loves Belle so much. Would you mind stopping by his room? It would really make his day.”
			    </p>
			    <p>
As I happily made my way down to his room, I learned that Jake was 9 years old and had met Belle in Disneyworld when he was younger. His mom said “he just fell in love with her, and has loved her ever since.”
			    </p>
			    <p>
I peeked my head into his room and found Cole in bed, cozied up in his Ninja Turtle pajamas and surrounded by stuffed animals from home. I said “Hi Cole!” Immediately his face turned bright red, a huge grin spread across his adorable face, and he exclaimed, “How did you find me!?”
			    </p>
			    <p>
As we talked about how he was feeling, his favorite TV shows, and life as a 9 year old he stared at me awe struck and with more love in his eyes than the very Beast himself. I told him I loved his pajamas and he said “Really!? I’m never taking these off!”
			    </p>
			    <p>
As mom was snapping pictures and as I was getting ready to leave, I told him he was so brave and that I was so happy to see him again. He waved goodbye and quickly added, “Belle, you know you’re my girlfriend right?” I smiled and nodded and his grin came back.
				<p>
With tears in her eyes his mother thanked me for coming and we both agreed his future girlfriends had pretty big shoes to fill.

				3 year old Michael followed me around the Atrium. He had never seen a princess before and was very excited. We sat down together to play legos but he quickly told me to go away because he wanted to build me a castle. “Come back when its finished” he said as he focused on his lego design.
				</p>
				<p>
I went around to visit some other kids, and after a bit Michael came running over to me. “Okay your castle is ready!!” He took my hand and led me to my new Lego kingdom. And he gave me a full tour. Pointing to different colored lego blocks he said, “thats the kitchen, that’s where the Beast lives, thats the library.” And finally he said, “I want you to feel safe in here Belle. And here’s a spot for your horse and carriage.”
				</p>

				<p>
				“Are you real or what?” 12 year old Jack asked me. He was on crutches and very suspicious of me. I asked him if he’d ever seen Beauty and the Beast. He said no. But then he said, “So what, you leave the movie and come here? Why do you do that?” I told him I liked spending time at the hospital visiting all the kids. He said, “They’re about to take my leg off. Is that why you came to see me?” I told him I didn’t know that but that he was being very strong. He said, “Yea, I got bit my a big dog and it got infected. That’s
pretty cool you came today. At least you could see me with both my legs.” He promised me he’d watch Beauty and the Beast while he was recovering, and I promised him I’d be back to visit again.

				One little girl was too sick to leave her bed so I sat with her at her bedside. We sang, talked about her room decorations and her favorite princesses, how much she loved dogs, and what she wanted to be when she grew up. She was very excited to show me her princess string lights that she could see from her bed. No other lights in her room were on so each princess was shining brightly. She excitedly pointed out the Belle light saying, “Look its you!” I told her whenever she was scared or feeling sick to turn those lights on. She smiled and said “Okay, Belle. Thank you for visiting me.”

				As I was walking through the hallway, a girl my age battling cancer yelped, “BELLE! You’re my favorite princess!! I need a picture girl!!!” Her room was fully decorated and it was clear she had been there for a while. Knowing she was my age really struck a chord with me. While I was planning where I was going out to dinner that night, she was settling in for another weekend in the hospital hooked up to an IV. She was joyful, smiling, and exuberant and reminded me so quickly how attitude is everything. She was my hero that day and I’ll hold her with me for a long time.

				Two little girls were playing together and were a little shy when I came over to visit them.
				</p>
				<p>
“What are your names?” I asked.
				</p>
				<p>
				“I’m Lilly and this is my friend Anna.”
				</p>
				<p>
They stuck close together as they explained to me that they were the big sisters of patients at the hospital. They had just turned 3 years old and had baby sisters awaiting treatment. They excitedly told me, “Our baby sisters are waiting to get BIG NEW hearts!!” Then they both jumped in the air in glee. The reality of an infant getting a heart transplant hit me fast and I was so glad that these two big sisters had found friendship and comfort in one another. They gave me a hug goodbye and went off hand in hand to the hospital library.
